I am Hrishikesh (natively written as ഋഷികേശ്  i in Malayalam).
The name is of Sanskrit origin, meaning "Lord/Master of senses".

I am a software engineer, privacy advocate, pythonista and a free software enthusiast. Most of my contributions has been in the language computing space under the aegis of the organisation [Swathathra Malayalam Computing](https://smc.org.in). I also contribute to the [PeARS Project](https://pearsearch.org) - which is an ongoing effort to build a fully distributed, p2p search engine.

I am one of the key architects of the [ICU movement](https://www.facebook.com/InternationalChaluUnion/), a socio cultural expression platform of the youth of the state. (as I'm occupied with other activities, I'm not active in ICU lately)

Apart from above mentioned projects, I have contributed to a number of Free and Open Source projects & movements and my relavant profiles are linked below.
